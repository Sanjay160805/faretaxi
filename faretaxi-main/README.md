ðŸš– Taxi Fare Prediction Project

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts taxi fares based on trip details such as:

1.Trip distance (calculated using Haversine formula) 

2.Pickup hour

3.Day of the week

4.Whether the trip occurs at night

The project includes:

1.Data preprocessing & feature engineering

2.Outlier removal & data cleaning

3.Model building using Gradient Boosting Regressor

4.Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV

5.Deployment using a Streamlit web app for live predictions
